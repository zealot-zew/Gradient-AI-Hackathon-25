                üéµ Dinosaurs, dinosaurs, long, long ago,
                Some were fast, some were slow!
                Dinosaurs, dinosaurs, big and small,
                Let's learn about them all! üéµ

                [ANIMATED INTRO: Cartoon dinosaurs marching across the screen]

                NARRATOR: Welcome to Dino Discovery Adventure! Today we're going back in time to meet some AMAZING creatures called DINOSAURS!

                [GAME ELEMENT: When children say "dinosaurs," animated footprints appear]

                Dinosaurs lived on Earth a VERY long time ago - more than 65 MILLION years ago! That's WAY before people existed!

                [ANIMATED SEQUENCE: Timeline showing dinosaurs then humans]

                There were many different kinds of dinosaurs:
                1. Some were HUGE like Brachiosaurus! (Stand up tall with arms stretched high)
                2. Some were TINY like Compsognathus! (Crouch down low)
                3. Some had SHARP TEETH like T-Rex! (Make chomping motions)
                4. Some ate PLANTS like Triceratops! (Pretend to munch leaves)

                [MOVEMENT BREAK: Children act out different dinosaur movements]

                [SONG BREAK]
                üéµ Stegosaurus had plates on its back,
                T-Rex had arms that were tiny,
                Pterodactyl could fly in the sky,
                Triceratops had three horns on its head! üéµ

                Scientists who study dinosaurs are called PALEONTOLOGISTS.
                Let's say that big word together: PAL-E-ON-TOL-O-GISTS!

                [GAME ELEMENT: Dinosaur dig where children find hidden fossils]

                Paleontologists find dinosaur bones called FOSSILS in the ground.
                These fossils help us learn what dinosaurs looked like and how they lived.

                [QUICK KNOWLEDGE CHECK]
                What do we call the scientists who study dinosaurs?
                (Pause for response)
                Great job! Paleontologists!

                What do we call dinosaur bones found in the ground?
                (Pause for response)
                That's right! Fossils!

                [CLOSING SONG]
                üéµ Now we know about dinosaurs,
                They lived long, long ago.
                Though they're gone from our world today,
                Their fossils help us know! üéµ

                THE END! You're now a dinosaur expert! ROAR!
